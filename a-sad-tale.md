House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm, Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned was invited to move to King's Landing, but he decided that the big city wasn't the place for him, so he stayed in Winterfell and spent his days happily and uneventfully (until white walkers came over the wall).
